# Role-based-Code

I believe Node JS(npm) and Angular Cli is already installed.

git clone

cd /Role-Based-Code

ng serve

Description:

There is a navigation bar with Admin and User link

change the role to "admin" or "user" in hero.service.ts and you can see only one component load.

If the role is "admin" then Only Admin menu link works and User link will redirect to home and vice versa.
